# Capstone project

Project Name: Music Player<br>

## About

Music Player is a web application built using React and Django. It allows a group of people to control the music being played in a playlist generated by the Spotify app in unity. The host creates a room in the Music Player app and a code is generated and sent to other users who can use this code to connect to the room where a playlist is being played through the Spotify app. When accessing the Music Player app, users are authenticated through a personal account in the Spotify app and redirected to the Music Player app where they can join a room with the code provided by the host. After joining the room they can listen to the song that is currently playing on their own device and can vote to skip the song that is currently playing if they wish. When the number of votes reaches the required limit, the next song on the list is played. The host can allow or not the users to pause or play the music. The host also sets the number of votes needed for a song to be skipped.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

The design is distinctive in many ways. One of them is the application's integration with the Spotify API, for authentication and to make it possible for the user to control the music being played in a Spotify playlist by the application itself, being able to advance, rewind, pause or play if he has permission to do so. Django is also configured to operate as an API, using the Django REST Framework.

The project frontend is built using the React library and not the Django html templates. The React frontend allows for fast coding of a transparent Single Page Application (SPA) with customizable aesthetics, quick DOM updates, among other benefits. The React Material UI component library has also been integrated to help with styling.
